            In a world of fur, where wonders unfurl,
            <br />
            There walks a Poodle, Ragnarök, a true pearl.
            <br /> With a coat of brown, he stands proud and tall,
            <br /> The best dog in the world, loved by all.
          </p>
          <p>
            {" "}
            His eyes sparkle with wisdom and grace,
            <br />A loyal companion, bringing joy to every place.
            <br /> With each wag of his tail, hearts are beguiled,
            <br /> Ragnarök, the embodiment of pure canine pride.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            From playful bounds to a gentle nudge,
            <br />
            He showers love and never holds a grudge. <br />
            Through days of sunshine or storms that whirl,
            <br />
            Ragnarök endures as the best dog in the world.
