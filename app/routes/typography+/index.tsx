            visual hierarchy, conveying brand identity, evoking emotions,
            ensuring accessibility, enhancing visual appeal, maintaining

            In addition to the common style props, all Typography components in
            Chakra-UI have access to the theme-based configuration for
            typography. This allows you to define a consistent typography style
            across your application by modifying the <Mono>theme</Mono> object.

                  text is accessible to all users, including those with visual
                  impairments. It involves using appropriate font sizes,
                  contrast ratios, and spacing to ensure legibility for
                  individuals with different abilities.
                </li>

                  typography system with defined font choices, styles, and
                  guidelines ensures a unified and professional look across
                  different sections of an application or website.
