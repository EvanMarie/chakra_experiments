            â¦¾ The <Mono>SkipNav</Mono> component is a useful tool in creating
            accessible web applications, offering keyboard users a fast track to
            the core content of a webpage.
          </SectionDescription>
          <BasicText>
            <Mono>SkipNav</Mono> is essentially composed of two components,{" "}
            <Mono>SkipNavLink</Mono> and <Mono>SkipNavContent</Mono>. These
            components come into play in enhancing website accessibility,
            particularly for keyboard users and screen readers. They offer a
            mechanism to bypass blocks of content that are repetitive across
            multiple pages, such as navigation links, allowing users to quickly
            access the main content of the page.
          </BasicText>

          <BulletBox>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <HL>SkipNavLink</HL>: one of the two primary components of the{" "}
                <Mono>SkipNav</Mono> functionality in Chakra UI. Its primary
                purpose is to create a hyperlink at the top of your application
                that enables keyboard users to swiftly skip to the main content
                of the webpage, bypassing repetitive elements. This component
                renders an <Code>{`<a>`}</Code> tag and automatically
                establishes a link with an <Code>{`href`}</Code> attribute that
                targets <Mono>SkipNavContent</Mono>. This link typically becomes
                one of the first items a user interacts with when they begin
                navigating a page after it has loaded. Hence, it is highly
                recommended to place it as high as possible in your app's
                structure.
              </li>
              <li>
                <HL>SkipNavContent</HL>: works in tandem with{" "}
                <Mono>SkipNavLink</Mono> to enhance the navigation experience
                for keyboard users and those using screen readers. This
                component serves as the target for the link generated by{" "}
                <Mono>SkipNavLink</Mono>. When the link is clicked or activated
                via keyboard, the focus shifts to the content encapsulated by{" "}
                <Mono>SkipNavContent</Mono>. When using a custom id with{" "}
                <Mono>SkipNavLink</Mono>, you'll need to ensure that the same id
                is utilized with <Mono>SkipNavContent</Mono>.{" "}
                <Mono>SkipNavContent</Mono> generates a <Code>{`<div>`}</Code>{" "}
                and can be employed as a self-closing component or used to wrap
                the main content.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </BulletBox>
          <DescriptionBox>
            {/* IMPORT CODE */}
            <ImportBox>
              <BasicText>
                These components can be imported as follows:
              </BasicText>
              <Highlighter>{`import { 
  SkipNavLink, 
  SkipNavContent } from '@chakra-ui/skip-nav'`}</Highlighter>
            </ImportBox>
          </DescriptionBox>

          <BasicText>
            In terms of usage, the <Mono>SkipNavLink</Mono> should ideally be
            one of the first items a user comes across when they start
            navigating a page after it has loaded. As such, it's best to
            position this component as high as possible within the application.
            This component generates an <Code>{`<a>`}</Code> tag and
            automatically creates a link with an href attribute pointing towards{" "}
            <Mono>SkipNavContent</Mono>.
          </BasicText>
          <BasicText>
            On the other hand, <Mono>SkipNavContent</Mono> is employed as the
            target for the link, setting the keyboard focus onto the first piece
            of main content. This component generates a <Code>{`<div>`}</Code>{" "}
            and can either be self-closing or wrap around the main content.
          </BasicText>
          <Navigation.E11 />
          <BasicText>
            The above code is an illustrative example of using the SkipNavLink
            and
            <Mono>SkipNavContent</Mono>. You can assign a custom id value using
            the id prop. However, make sure to use the same id for both the{" "}
            <Mono>SkipNavLink</Mono> and <Mono>SkipNavContent</Mono> components,
            ensuring they correspond to each other.
          </BasicText>
          <Navigation.E12 />
        </Box>
      </SectionContainer>
    </BigBackgroundBox>
